     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
     * Output: true
     * Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone,
     * then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone,
     * 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
     * Output: false
     * Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.*/
